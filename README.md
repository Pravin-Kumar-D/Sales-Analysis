# Sales Analysis

A brief description of what this project does and who it's f dor


## 1. Objective
The goal of this project was to build a **3-page interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard in Power BI** that helps business stakeholders understand:

- Key revenue drivers
- Product profitability
- Customer value
- Regional performance
- Operational inefficiencies (delivery delays)
- Customer retention trends

This dashboard supports **faster decisions, better insights, and data-driven strategy**.
## 2. Dataset
**Global Superstore Dataset** (Kaggle)

Contains:

- Orders
- Customers
- Products
- Categories & Sub-categories
- Regions / States
- Sales, Profit, Quantity
- Discounts
- Shipping dates & modes
## 3. Key Business Questions Solved
The dashboard answers the following real-world questions:

### *Sales & Product*

1. Which products and categories drive the most sales and profit?
2. How do sales and profit trend over time?

### *Customers*

1. Which customer segments are most valuable?
2. What is customer repeat behavior and retention?

### *Regions*

1. Which regions/states underperform or outperform?

### *Operations*

1. What operational issues (shipping delays) affect customer satisfaction?

### *Leadership Insights*

1. What are the top actionable insights for business leaders?
## 4. Assumptions
- Shipping Delay = **Ship Date – Order Date**
- Profit Margin % = **Profit / Sales**
- Avg Order Value = **Total Sales / Total Orders**
- Returning customer = customers with **>1 order**
- Missing numeric values were filled with 0 when appropriate, or removed if they could not be used reliably
- Date dimensions follow standard calendar year-month format
## 5. SQL Transformations
Performed before loading into Power BI:

- **Created database and staging table (`stg_superstore`)** using `SELECT INTO`
- **Removed duplicate records** using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Order_ID, Product_ID ORDER BY Row_ID)`
- **Cleaned and standardized text fields** using `LTRIM()`, `RTRIM()`, and `UPPER()` for customer, region, state, city, and product names
- **Created computed columns** for business logic:
    - `ShippingDelay` (Ship_Date – Order_Date)
    - `ProfitMargin` (Profit / Sales, with divide-by-zero handling)
    - `OrderYear`, `OrderMonth`, `OrderQuarter`
- **Validated date quality** by checking for invalid rows where `Ship_Date < Order_Date`
- **Ensured consistent datatypes** for all columns using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
- **Maintained clean backup and staging layers** to separate raw data from cleaned data
## 6. Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- Removed rows with no Order ID or Customer ID
- Blank numeric cells replaced with 0
- understood data using column quality, column profile and column distribution

## 7. Data Modeling (Star Schema)
### *Fact Table*

stg_superstore

### *Dimension Tables* 
(Dimension tables were created to organize the data more effectively and support a clean, high-performance star-schema model)

- Dim Customers
- Dim Date
- Dim Products

### *Relationships*

- 1–Many: DimDate → stg_superstore
- 1–Many: DimCustomer → stg_superstore
- 1–Many: DimProduct → stg_superstore
## 8. Key DAX Measures
### Core Metrics:

```
Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Sales])

Total Profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])

Customer Count = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Customer ID])

Avg Shipping Days = AVERAGE(Orders[Shipping Delay])

Avg Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Sales], COUNTROWS(Orders))

Returning Customers = COUNTROWS(FILTER(ADDCOLUMNS('Dim Customer',"Order Count", CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(stg_superstore))),[Order Count]>1))

Retention Count = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('Dim Customer'[Customer_ID]),
    FILTER(
        ALL(stg_superstore),
        stg_superstore[Order Year Month] = SELECTEDVALUE('Dim Date'[YearMonth])
    ),
    FILTER(
        ALL('Dim Customer'),
        'Dim Customer'[Cohort Month] = SELECTEDVALUE('Dim Customer'[Cohort Month]
    )
)
)
```

### Time Intelligence:

```
Rolling 3M Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESINPERIOD(DimDate[Date], MAX(DimDate[Date]), -3, MONTH))
```

### Product Page (Top N Filter):

```
Rank = RANKX(ALLSELECTED(stg_superstore[Product_Name]),[Product Sales],,DESC)

Is In TopN = 
VAR SelectedTopN = SELECTEDVALUE('TopN'[TopNValue], 10)
RETURN
IF(
    SelectedTopN = 0,
    1,
    IF([Rank] <= SelectedTopN, 1, 0)
)
```

## 9. Dashboard Pages
### *Page 1 — Sales Overview*

Contains:

- Six KPI Cards
- Monthly Sales Trend (3M rolling average)
- Sales by Category
- Top 5 Products
- Sales by State Map
- Segment × Category Profit Matrix
- Quick Insights Box

Insights:

- Technology is top profit driver
- Furniture  → lower margins
- Avg Shipping Delay around 4 days

### *Page 2 — Product Performance*

Contains:

- Product slicer + Top N selector
- Pareto Chart (Sales + Cumulative %)
- Sales vs Profit Scatter Plot (quantity = bubble size)
- Detailed product-level table with sparklines
- Recommendations card

Insights:

- 20% of products drive ~80% of sales
- Some high-volume products generate negative profit

## 10. Limitations
- Dataset is simulated
- No COGS → cannot compute true gross margin
- No marketing data
- Static data: no real-time refresh
- No return data
## 11. Future Enhancements
- Add **Churn Prediction** model
- Add **Sales Forecasting (ML)**
- Add **RFM Segmentation**
- Build **What-If Pricing Simulator**
- Add **Mobile layout**
- Include **Inventory analytics**
## 12. Final Summary
This project demonstrates:

- End-to-end BI development (SQL → Power Query → DAX → Visualization)
- Clean modeling using Star Schema
- Insight-driven storytelling
- Ability to answer real business questions

This Sales Dashboard equips stakeholders with a **overview of performance** and enables **data-driven decisions across sales, operations, customer behavior, and product strategy**.
